                Ajanta Caves, Buddhist rock-cut cave temples and monasteries, located near Ajanta village, north-central Maharashtra state, western India, that are celebrated for their wall paintings. The temples are hollowed out of granite cliffs on the inner side of a 70-foot (20-metre) ravine in the Wagurna River valley 65 miles (105 km) northeast of Aurangabad, at a site of great scenic beauty.

            The Ajanta and Ellora Caves are located in Maharashtra, India, and are famous for their rock-cut architecture. The Ajanta Caves are Buddhist while the Ellora Caves consist of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain temples and shrines. They are UNESCO World Heritage sites, recognized for their cultural and historical significance. For more detailed information, I recommend visiting the official UNESCO website or a trusted encyclopedia.
