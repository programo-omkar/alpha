               <b> Shirdi</b> (pronunciationⓘ; also known as Sainagar) is a city and pilgrimage site in the Indian state of Maharashtra.[1][2] Shirdi is home to 19th century Indian satguru Sai Baba's samadhi mandir. It is located in the Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar District. It is accessible via the Ahmednagar–Malegaon State Highway No.10, approximately 83 km (52 mi) from Ahmednagar and 15 km (9.3 mi) from Kopargaon. It is located 185 km (115 mi) east of the Ahmednagar–Manmad road.[3] Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust is located in Shirdi.[4]

                Every day, over 60,000 tourists and devotees from all faiths and religions throng to the temple, and this number increases during festive seasons. The temple opens at 4:45 am[5] Other places related to the life of Shri Sai in Shirdi include Dwarkamai Mandir, Chavadi and Gurusthan.[1][2]
                
                Dwarkamai Mandir, where Baba lived, with a temple inside, is the only one of its kind and importance in India. Another interesting aspect of the dwarkamai mandir is that the Dhuni, or holy fire that Sai Baba lit here has been always kept burning to this day. There is a Gurusthan under the Neem tree where, according to Baba, the original samadhi of his own guru is located and Where Baba was found during his Balyog or Yuva avastha.This place is considered to be a very important because of this reason.[6][7]
